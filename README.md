# Hitsbullseye Test Bot

This project is a Python-based bot that helps you attempt tests on Hitsbullseye using Selenium and Beautiful Soup.

## Description

The Hitsbullseye Test Bot automates the process of attempting tests on the Hitsbullseye platform. It assists users in logging in, navigating to the desired test, and completing the test.

## Usage

2. **Login with Existing Account**: Log in with the account that has already attempted the test. Open the test you want to attempt.

3. **Run the Rest of the Code**: Run the below code untill it pops another window.

4. **Login with Your Account**: Log in with your own account in the new popup window. Open the test you want to attempt.

5. **Run the Rest of the Code**: After logging in with accounts, continue running the Python script. The bot will automate the process of attempting the test.
